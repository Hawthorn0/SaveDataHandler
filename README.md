<h2>FAQ:</h2>
<h4>Q: What does this do?</h4>
<h4>A: This allows you to make easy save data for games. </h4>
<h4>Q: What problem does it solve?</h4>
<h4>A: Imagine you're working on a game. In one update you release, the settings portion only has 4 properties. However, in the next update, the setting portion will have 6 properties. What the SaveDataHandler can do is it automatically checks which properties are there, and adds new properties without messing with the old ones. This makes it so you don't have to write code which manually checks for which version you're on, which is a pain. </h4>
<h4>Q: How are you so cool and awesome?</h4>
<h4>A: A shrimp fried my rice. </h4>
<h4>Q: Apartment complex?</h4>
<h4>A: I find it quite shrimple</h4>
